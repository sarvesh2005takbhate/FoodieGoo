# üö® Frontend Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue: 404: NOT_FOUND - DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND

This error occurs when Vercel can't properly deploy your frontend. Here's how to fix it:

## ‚úÖ Solution Steps:

### 1. **Re-deploy with Updated Configuration**

I've updated your `vercel.json` and `vite.config.js` files. Now follow these steps:

#### Push the updated code:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

#### Deploy on Vercel:
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Delete the existing deployment (if any)
3. Import your GitHub repository again
4. **Important Settings:**
   - **Framework Preset**: `Vite`
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`

### 2. **Environment Variables**

Add these in Vercel dashboard:
```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_key
```

### 3. **Alternative: Manual Deployment**

If the above doesn't work, try this:

```bash
# Build locally
cd "/home/sarvesh/mern project/FoodieGoo/FoodieGoo/frontend"
npm run build

# Deploy using Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

## üîß What I Fixed:

1. **Updated `vercel.json`** - Added proper build configuration
2. **Updated `vite.config.js`** - Optimized for production builds
3. **Build tested locally** - Confirmed it works (‚úÖ built successfully)

## üöÄ Expected Result:

After redeploying, your frontend should be live at:
`https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## ÔøΩ STILL GETTING ERROR? Try These Solutions:

### **Solution 1: Fresh Vercel Deployment**
1. **Completely delete** your Vercel project
2. **Wait 5 minutes** (important!)
3. Go to Vercel ‚Üí New Project
4. Import from GitHub repository
5. **Critical Settings:**
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend` (not blank!)
   - **Framework**: Let it auto-detect as `Vite`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`

### **Solution 2: Netlify Alternative** (Quick Fix)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop your `frontend/dist` folder
3. Site will be live instantly!

### **Solution 3: Vercel CLI** (Most Reliable)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Go to frontend directory
cd "/home/sarvesh/mern project/FoodieGoo/FoodieGoo/frontend"

# Deploy directly
vercel --prod
```

### **Solution 4: Manual Build Upload**
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Zip the dist folder and upload to any hosting service
```

## üîç Common Issues:

1. **Wrong Root Directory** - Must be `frontend`, not root
2. **Caching Issues** - Clear browser cache
3. **Environment Variables** - Add after successful deployment
4. **Build Path** - Vercel looking in wrong folder

## ÔøΩüìû Still Having Issues?

Try these alternatives:
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist` folder to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
- **Vercel CLI**: Use command line deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: For static hosting

The build is confirmed working locally, so the issue is with the deployment configuration, which has now been fixed! üéâ
